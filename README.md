# Japanese Quiz

Japanese Quiz is a tool designed to help you learn Japanese by enhancing your memory of the 50 basic sounds.

Mastering the 50 basic sounds is often the first challenge for many learners of the Japanese language. While practicing, I recalled a set of applications I used when learning English called Anki. It featured a "flashcard mode" that I found effective in reinforcing vocabulary memorization. Recognizing its effectiveness, I decided to create a similar flashcard quiz to aid in my Japanese language studies.

The reason for developing a web page is its accessibility – you can instantly use it by opening a web browser without the need to download any apps. It's incredibly convenient!

## Overview

The quiz itself has a straightforward design, focusing on memorizing corresponding Rome or Hiragana/Katakana based on flashcards. However, it boasts the following features:

- Cross-platform support (available on both mobile and desktop)
- User-friendly interface with simple and clear operations (just click buttons and flip cards to check answers)
- Tracks statistics on the number of correct and incorrect responses for each sound, facilitating analysis of one's familiarity with specific sounds.

## Development

Currently, the project is written in vanilla JavaScript. To run the project locally, you can clone the repository and set it up with a local server. However, in the future, there may be considerations to switch to a framework or other libraries for rewriting.

## Todo

- Implement a countdown feature (for each flashcard).
- Integrate a review function (for words categorized as incorrect).
- Introduce a Katakana mode.
